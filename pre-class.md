# **Pre-class Study: Advanced SQL Navigation**

Welcome! Before our session, we need to ensure your "cockpit" is ready for flight. We will be using **DuckDB**, a high-performance database, and **DbGate** as our control center.

## **1. Environment Setup**

* **Database File:** Ensure you have the unit-1-5.db file downloaded to a known folder on your computer.

## **2. Key Concepts to Recall**

Think of a database like a library.

* **Metadata** is the card catalog (information about the books).  
* **Tables** are the shelves.  
* **Joins** are the connections we make when a book in the "Authors" section refers to a book in the "Geography" section.

## **3. The "Why" of Advanced SQL**

In basic SQL, we ask simple questions: "Show me all clients."  
In advanced SQL, we ask analytical questions: "Show me the top 10% of clients based on their insurance claim history compared to their peers in the same city."

### **Self-Study Task:**

1. Open DbGate.  
2. Create a new "DuckDB" connection.  
3. Point it to the unit-1-5.db file.  
4. Run: SELECT * FROM client LIMIT 5; to verify connection.

*Ready? See you in class where we turn these tables into insights\!*
